				'I was born prematurely and I have a little dog that has a very snobby personality.',
			learned:
				'I learned some web development to program this very page (the Angryneers page). I learned how to design, paint and build a thematic kiosk.I had to sacrifice many nights of sleep and relaxation during the winter break by learning to code from absolutely no experience in web development. Initially, I thought this path would be too difficult and boring, but I could not have been more wrong. I had so much fun learning to program and debug my code, that I actually plan on doing more web dev in the future.'

			funFacts:
				"Sometimes I describe my dreams using mathematical formulas and functions. Also, when I'm reading, I become so immersed in the book that I don't hear the people addressing me.",
			learned:
				"I learned how to (and how not to) use electrical motors and motor controllers, as well as their different types. I also learned the principles behind the omni-wheels design and function. I acquired the skills to identify and eliminate the bottlenecks in the robot's development. I applied my knowledge of programming, and learned to utilize parsing, graph theory and design patterns in my code. Finally, I have completed an advanced Python course and a course on design patterns to prepare for the programming competition. To participate on the robotics team, I sacrificed participating in other clubs and meeting friends during Activity Periods, as well as the second half of my winter vacation."

			learned:
				'While building the website, I learned how to use the Bootstrap framework to style and position elements. I also learned more about Svelte. While building the kiosk, I learned many things involved in kiosk building such as how to fill holes, sand, and paint walls. I had to sacrifice a lot of my winter break time, but overall I am happy that I used this time to learn new skills.'

			learned:
				'Working alongside talented teammates, I honed problem-solving skills through the design, testing, debugging, and enhancement of our robot for specific goals. Through trial and error, we crafted a reliable flywheel system, ensuring precise ball launches.Balancing academics and other extracurricular activities with robotics was challenging, but it taught me effective time management and organizational skills.'
